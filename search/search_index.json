Using light data\u2014and, in some cases, additional input such as temperature readings\u2014the system automatically opens or closes the blinds to maintain a comfortable indoor balance. By monitoring brightness levels throughout the day, it helps regulate room temperature, reducing the need for heating when sunlight is available. This automation also removes the need for manual adjustment, improving both energy efficiency and overall comfort.</li> </ul>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"#my-contribution","title":"My Contribution","text":"<p>We are a team of engineering students from Arizona State University dedicated to turning embedded system ideas into practical, market-ready solutions.

The sensor connects to pin RA0, which receives the light data from the photoresistor. The microcontroller then sends an inverting signal as confirmation that the system should activate, which is output through pin RA2 to control the rest of the system. A shared ground connection on pin 8 ensures all boards operate at the same reference point.

This allows for amplifying the difference of input voltage created by the PDV-P8103 CDS PHOTORESISTOR 16-33KOHM.
