MCP6004-I/P IC OPAMP GP 4 CIRCUIT 14DIP</p> <p>Rationale: A clock oscillator is easier to work with because it requires no external circuitry in order to interface with the PSoC. This allows for amplifying the difference of input voltage created by the PDV-P8103 CDS PHOTORESISTOR 16-33KOHM. By amplifying the difference the pic can read the levels and once surpassing a threshold or certain levels it sets the blind to pre determined positions </p>"},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/","title":"Bill of Materials","text":"","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>written context</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/#bill-of-materials-example-as-table","title":"Bill of Materials Example (as Table)","text":"<p>Table ##: An example of one approach to adding your BOM table to this section.</p> Part Name/Description Qty Unit Cost Total Cost Manufacture Manufacturer # Vendor Link Datasheet Link Schematic Reference Designators 8-bit SIPO/SISO Shift Register, SOIC-16 package 1 $0.49 $ 0.49 NXP 74HC595D,112 DigiKey datasheet link U1 0.1 \u00b5F Ceramic Capacitor, +/-10%, X7R, 50V, 0805 package 10 0.2750 $2.75 KEMET C0805F104K5RACTU PRLTA 109 n/a C2, C4, C6, C7, C8, C9, C10, C11, C12, C16 <p>Note: Setting it up as a table is nice because it is completely viewable without scaling issues.
