Once triggered, it sends a signal to my teammate Keith\u2019s subsystem for further action. For an overview of the main components, refer to the Block Diagram. The system uses a PIC18F57Q43 microcontroller (MCU) and a photoresistor to sense changes in ambient light intensity. It converts the photoresistor\u2019s analog signal into a digital reading for processing. A key feature is its adjustable sensitivity, which allows calibration for different environments. By continuously monitoring brightness, the system helps regulate room temperature\u2014for example, reducing heating when sunlight is sufficient. This automation removes the need for manual adjustment, improving both energy efficiency and occupant comfort.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"#my-contribution","title":"My Contribution","text":"<p>My contributions extended beyond the outlined scope of the light sensor and team coordination.
