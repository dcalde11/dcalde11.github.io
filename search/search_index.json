While my main subsystem was the automated light sensor, I also supported my teammates with the development of their parts of the project. Managing the schedule meant making tough calls on priorities, and though some deadlines shifted, I am proud of our final result. This record outlines my contributions to the electrical setup and performance that made the project a success.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"#project-summary","title":"Project Summary","text":"<p>The subsystem is designed to trigger a mode change by detecting a specified light threshold using a photoresistor. Once triggered, it sends a signal to my teammate Keith\u2019s subsystem for further action. For an overview of the main components, refer to the Block Diagram. The system uses a PIC18F57Q43 microcontroller (MCU) and a photoresistor to sense changes in ambient light intensity. It converts the photoresistor\u2019s analog signal into a digital reading for processing. A key feature is its adjustable sensitivity, which allows calibration for different environments. By continuously monitoring brightness, the system helps regulate room temperature\u2014for example, reducing heating when sunlight is sufficient. This automation removes the need for manual adjustment, improving both energy efficiency and occupant comfort.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"#my-contribution","title":"My Contribution","text":"<p>My contributions extended beyond the outlined scope of the light sensor and team coordination. I actively participated in the development of all subsystems by ensuring proper builds, debugging hardware issues, and revising schematics to ensure wiring matched component datasheets. I also assisted with coding across other subsystems. This comprehensive involvement was crucial for tying the different parts of the project together, ensuring clear signals and smooth overall system operation. Stepping into various roles significantly helped my growth as an engineer. Troubleshooting hardware developed my problem-solving skills, and working across different subsystems and their code gave me an understanding of how systems integrate in a real project.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"#team-contribution","title":"Team Contribution","text":"<ul> <li>EGR304 Team 105 Report \u2013 Product Requirements</li> <li>EGR304 Team 105 \u2013 User Needs and Benchmarking</li> </ul>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"#individual-contribution","title":"Individual Contribution","text":"<ul> <li>To review the details and relationships between the system\u2019s components, refer to the Block Diagram section of the datasheet.</li> <li>To review the system\u2019s components, refer to the Component Selection.</li> <li>To review power distribution, refer to the Power Budget.</li> <li>To review the layout of the individual subsystem, refer to the Schematic.</li> <li>To review the cost of components in the subsystem, refer to the Bill of Materials.</li> </ul>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/","title":"Individal Block Diagram","text":"","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/#system-overview","title":"System Overview","text":"<p>This system provides a structured approach to sensing ambient light, conditioning the resulting analog signal, and processing it through an embedded microcontroller platform.
