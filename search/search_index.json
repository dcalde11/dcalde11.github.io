Using light data\u2014and, in some cases, additional input such as temperature readings\u2014the system automatically opens or closes the blinds to maintain a comfortable indoor balance. By monitoring brightness levels throughout the day, it helps regulate room temperature, reducing the need for heating when sunlight is available.

This allows for amplifying the difference of input voltage created by the PDV-P8103 CDS PHOTORESISTOR 16-33KOHM.
