## Overview
The Light Sensor Subsystem BOM lists all components required for prototyping and production, including passive elements (resistors, capacitors), active devices (PIC18F57Q43, MCP6004, photoresistor), and necessary connectors. Each entry specifies quantity, cost, manufacturer, and sourcing links, with designators mapping components to the schematic. Additional hardware such as switches, LEDs, and test points supports safe operation, testing, and integration. Overall, the BOM ensures efficient assembly and transition from prototype to production.
