## Introduction

* To record entrys of data and with notes on how my contribution and perspective led to the completion regarding tasks and projects
### Project Summary

* The sensor’s readings are sent to a microcontroller or smart blind controller, which uses the light data (and possibly temperature data from other sensors) to decide whether to open or close the blinds. By monitoring the brightness of the room, the system automatically adjusts the blinds to maintain a balanced temperature—reducing the need for heating when it’s cool and sunny. This automation also removes the daily task of manually opening and closing the blinds to manage light and comfort.
