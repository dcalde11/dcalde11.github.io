## Introduction

* This section includes my notes and observations for the light sensor automation project. My main tasks involved wiring and testing the electrical components, ensuring proper connections and stable signal readings from the sensor. I also worked on improving how the system reacted to changes in light to maintain smooth and reliable operation. Overall, this record outlines my contributions to the electrical setup and performance that supported the successful completion of the project.
### Project Summary

* The sensor detects the light intensity in the environment and sends its readings to a control system that determines the appropriate position of the blinds. Using light data—and, in some cases, additional input such as temperature readings—the system automatically opens or closes the blinds to maintain a comfortable indoor balance. By monitoring brightness levels throughout the day, it helps regulate room temperature, reducing the need for heating when sunlight is available. This automation also removes the need for manual adjustment, improving both energy efficiency and overall comfort.



### My Contribution

We are a team of engineering students from Arizona State University dedicated to turning embedded system ideas into practical, market-ready solutions. Our project, Temperature Equalizing Blinds, focuses on automating blind adjustments to improve comfort and energy efficiency. The section below highlights my individual role and contributions to the project’s development.
