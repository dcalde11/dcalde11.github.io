## OverView
The PCB supports the system’s electronic functionality by hosting the primary components, routing power, and managing signal pathways. The front side contains the microcontroller, voltage regulation circuitry, connectors, and sensor interfaces, with copper traces distributing power and signals and silkscreen labels aiding assembly. The back side provides additional routing and grounding to reduce noise and maintain signal integrity, with minimal components to ensure clarity and reliable operation. Both layers work together to support stable power delivery, accurate signal processing, and overall system performance.
### Front PCB
* The front side of the PCB hosts the primary components, including the microcontroller, voltage regulators, connectors, and sensors. Copper traces distribute power and signals across the board, while silkscreen labels assist with clear identification and assembly. This layer serves as the main interface for system control, power regulation, and signal processing.

### Back PCB

* The back side of the PCB provides supporting routing, ground planes, and additional electrical connections that enhance signal integrity and noise reduction. Minimal components are placed on this layer to maintain clarity and ensure reliable operation, with through-hole pads and vias connecting the circuitry between layers for stable system performance.
